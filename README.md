# Rspec Geometry Lab

You've just started using RSpec, and now is the time to practice it more and expand your TDD skills.

We're going to TDD building a `Geometry` module that holds the classes of `Triangle`, `Rectangle` and `Circle`.

The `Triangle` will have instance variables of `@sideA`, `@sideB` and `@sideC`. `Triangle` needs methods to calculate the `perimeter`, `area`, `angles` (outputs an array of angles), and `valid?`.

The `Rectangle` will have instance variables of `@length` and `@width`. It needs methods to calcualte the perimeter and area of the rectangle.

The `Circle` will have a `@radius` instance variable, and methods for calculating `circumference` and `area`

Use Rspec to TDD the building of these. Then turn in with a Pull Request.
